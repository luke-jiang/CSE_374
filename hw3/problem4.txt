1.
The second line sets the x-label of the result plot as "Rank"
The third line sets the y-label of the result plot as "Size (Bytes)"
The fourth line sets the range of x-label as range 0 to 100 (inclusive)
The fifth line specifies output to a file named "scatterplot.eps"
The last line specifies input filename as "results.txt", using the first column
  as x and the third column as y. The result file is titled with empty string
  and plotted with "points" style

2.
From the scatterplot I get, there isn't a pattern strong and obvious enough to
make the conclusion that the popularity of a website and the byte size of index.html
have any statistical relationship. This is not what I expected. I thought more
popular websites would have a smaller index.html file, because if lots of users
are accessing a certain popular website simultaneously, a big index.html file
would takes more time to load and makes the server even busier, and the users
might find the website is slow.
