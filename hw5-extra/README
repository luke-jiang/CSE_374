Extra Credit:

1.
If the user types a prefix, the program will traverse along the first
non-NULL children of the trie until the current node contains a valid word
and return that word. If no valid word is found, print "not found in the current
directory" to the output.

2.
The TrieNode has an additional field that stores the frequency of each node.
Words that have the same t9 code are stored in the order of decreasing frequency.
Duplicate words are treated like different words, because a word can have multiple
different meanings. The program ignores any word that is not a string of lower
case letters, like "FALSE" and "co-operate".

3.
When a word is queried by the user, the frequency field of the node that stores
that word increases by one. If the node's frequency becomes larger than its
parent's, it will be swapped with its parent to keep the list in sorted order.
When two words have the same frequency, the one that most recently queried by
the user will be the output.
