	<h1>Homework 1 (CSE 374 Spring 2018)</h1>
	<p><b>Due: Tuesday, April 3, 2018, at 11pm</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<p>The purpose of this assignment is for you to become familiar with the basics
	  of the Linux shell and the range of commands that are included in most Linux
	  distributions. This very definitely does not include all of the commands you
	  will need for this course. Instead, it is aimed to help you learn about some
	  basic commands as well as 
	  how to  discover  more on your own. You should use the Linux Pocket
	  Guide and the Linux <code>man</code> command 
	  or the online version of the Linux man pages (see the link on the course web site)
	  to find specific commands needed
	  to answer these questions, and use the Pocket Guide to  read about
	  related commands and topics. Google is also useful for locating things, but you need to learn your way around the Guide and the standard Linux documentation, which is the primary source.</p>
	<p>There are two parts of the assignment. In Part I you are asked to run several
	  commands  and capture the terminal session in a
	  script file to hand in. Part II consists of several questions to be answered
	  in a separate file. You should turn in both files when you are done.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Part I</h2>

	<p>Use the command <code>script hw1.part1</code> to start
	  a shell and save the input and output into a file <code>hw1.part1</code>. Then
	  run the commands needed to answer the following questions. If you make a few small mistakes you don't need to start over, but include comments (input lines
	  starting with #) after non-trivial goofs so we can follow your output easily. Also don't worry about &quot;invisible&quot; control characters like tabs and backspaces that are captured in the script file. That is normal and not something that needs to be fixed. </p>

	<p>It would also be helpful if you included some comments to identify
	  answers to the different sets of questions to make it easier for the graders to navigate through the output.</p>

	<h3>Getting started</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li> Enter a command to print &quot;Hello world&quot; on the screen. </li>
	  <li> Change your password. (You can change it back later if you want - don't forget
	    it, though, you'll need it to log in next time.)</li>
	  <li> Display the current date and time on the screen.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>File paths and directory navigation</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li value="4"> Display the full path of your home directory.</li>
	  <li>Go to your home directory. </li>
	  <li> List all the files in your current directory. </li>
	  <li> Now, create a new folder
	    called &#8216;temp&#8217;. </li>
	  <li> Rename this folder to &#8216;files&#8217;. </li>
	  <li> Go to the &#8216;files&#8217; folder. </li>
	  <li> Run a command to get the current
	    date and time and save the output to a file called 'now' </li>
	  <li> Copy &#8216;now&#8217; to a file
	    called 'before' </li>
	  <li> List all the files in this directory. Use a more
	    detailed listing where you can see the files' permissions, date written, etc. </li>
	  <li> Create a file called 'temp' without using a text editor. (There are at
	    least three easy ways to do this.)</li>
	  <li> Rename 'temp'
	    to 'test'</li>
	  <li> Go up one directory. </li>
	  <li> Delete the &#8216;files&#8217; folder with a single command. (The command
	    you use should also delete all of the files inside of the folder.)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Permissions</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li value="17"> Create a file called 'secretfile' containing the text &#8220;It's
	    a secret!&#8221; using
	    the <code>echo</code> command. </li>
	  <li> Change the permission of this file in such a way so that
	    no one can write to it. Use the <code>ls</code> command to show the file
	    name and permissions.</li>
	  <li> Try to add more text to 'secretfile' using the
	    <code>cat</code> command.</li>
	  <li> Change permission of this file so that no one can read
	    it. Use the <code>ls</code> command again to show the file name and permissions.</li>
	  <li> Try to read the file using <code>cat</code>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Process Information</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li value="22"> Enter a command to display the version of the Linux kernel
	    that you are you using.</li>
	  <li> List all of the processes that belong to you (i.e., have your login id
	    as the process user id) that are currently running.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Searching</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li value="24"> Use grep to display the entry with your username  in the
	    file '/etc/passwd'.</li>
	</ol>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Part II</h2>
	<p>Use a text editor (emacs suggested - you should learn how to use it at some
	  point, even if you later use something else - although it ok to use vim instead if you insist) to create a plain text file named <code>hw1.part2</code> containing
	  answers to the following questions:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Use the man pages to find out what wc does. Give a brief description of
	    it here. What does the -l option for wc do?</li>
	  <li>Run wc on the directory '/etc/passwd' and copy and paste your findings.</li>
	  <li>What
	    command would you use to terminate (stop) a process?</li>
	  <li>What information does the environment variable $HOME
	    store? (Hint: use 'echo $HOME' to investigate.)</li>
	  <li>List two other important environment
	    variables on your computer and what they store. Why are these variables important?</li>
	  <li>If
	    you created a file 'bigredbutton' somewhere on your computer and couldn't
	    remember what folder it was in, what command could you use to find it? Just
	    give the name of the command. You do not need to describe all of the necessary
	    arguments.</li>
	  <li>How is the command in the answer to the previous question different from
	    the 'which' command?</li>
	  <li>How does the command &#8220;echo
	    Hello World! &gt; something&#8221; differ  from &#8220;echo
	    Hello World!&#8221;? </li>
	  <li>Assume we have run the first echo command from the previous question and now
	    we execute &#8220;echo
	    more text &gt; something&#8221;.
	    Describe what this does.</li>
	  <li>Now assume we have run the commands in the previous two questions and now we execute &#8220;echo
	    yet more text &gt;&gt; something&#8221;.
	    Describe what this does.<br>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Your solutions will be evaluated on how
	  well they follow the instructions
	  and produce the desired results in part I, and on the correctness and conciseness
	  of your answers in part II.
	  Note: Remember that we will check your solutions using CSE's CentOS Linux system.
	  Be sure that your answers are valid on the CSE systems (either klaatu
	  or the CSE home virtual machine).
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>Turn-in Instructions:</strong> Use the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1199331/assignments/4176725">turn-in drop box link</a>
	  to turn the <code>hw1.part1</code> file created in part I and the <code>hw1.part2</code> file with your answers to the questions 
	  from part II. The drop box will allow you to turn in your homework up to
	  two days late, if you choose to use one or two of your late days, but you are
	  <em><strong>strongly</strong></em> advised to save your 
	  late days for later in the quarter when they are almost certain to be much more useful.
