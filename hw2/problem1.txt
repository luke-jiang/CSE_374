echo aardvark
Explanation: command 'echo' prints the input string 'aardvark' to stdout.

cat <<< aardvark
Explanation: redirection operator '<<<' takes a string as stdin, command 'cat'
prints the content of stdin to stdout.

touch aardvark
ls aardvark
Explanation: the first command 'touch' creates a new file with filename 'aardvark',
and the second command 'ls' finds a file in the current directory by name 'aardvark'
and prints the filename.

echo aardvark > aardvark
grep --color=never aardvark ./aardvark
Explanation: the first command creates a new file named 'aardvark' or overwrites
the content of an existing 'aardvark' file with string 'aardvark'. The second command
search the pattern 'aardvark' in file 'aardvark' and output matches with no color.
Since the aardvark file contains only the 'aardvark' string, the output of 'grep'
is only 'aardvark'

alias aardvark=" "
aardvark
!!
Explanation: Command '!!' prints out the last pair of input and output in history.
After making aardvark as an alias for a whitespace, entering 'aardvark' to bash
is equivalent to entering a whitespace, which does nothing and has no output.
Therefore, command '!!' would print only the previous input string 'aardvark'.
