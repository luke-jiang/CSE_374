	<h2>Assignment goal</h2>

	<p>The purpose of this assignment is to gain some experience with C
	  programming by implementing a utility program that is similar
	  to <code>grep</code>, but without the ability to process regular
	  expressions (i.e., a lot like a simple version
	  of <code>fgrep</code>). In particular, in this assignment, you will:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Gain  experience creating and running C programs,</li>
	    <li>Become familiar with some of the basic C libraries, including those for
	      file and string handling,</li>
	    <li>Get a better understanding of how Unix utilities are implemented,</li>
	    <li>Gain some basic experience with the unix debugger, <code>gdb</code>, and</li>
	    <li>Learn to use a style-checking tool to locate source code that may need attention.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p>This assignment does not include any particularly complicated logic
	  or algorithms, but it will require you to organize your code well
	  and make effective use of the C language and libraries. You will
	  also have to explore the details of the C string and file I/O
	  libraries to discover how to do various operations that should
	  already be familiar from your programming experience in other
	  languages, but which are different in C. It is meant as an
	  orientation to the Unix/Linux C programming environment. You should
	  do this assignment by yourself.</p>

	<p>The material that we have learned in lecture <b><em>is not enough</em></b>
	  to complete this assignment. It is expected that you will investigate
	  the resources and libraries mentioned in this document to learn about
	  how to use them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Synopsis</h2>

	<p>Implement in C a Unix utility program <code>gasp</code>.  The command
	  <pre>       $ ./gasp [options] STRING FILE...</pre>  should read the listed
	  files (<code>FILE...</code>) and copy each line from the input
	  to <code>stdout</code> if it contains <code>STRING</code> anywhere in
	  the input line.  Each output line should be preceded by the name of
	  the file that contains it. The argument <code>STRING</code> may be any
	  sequence of characters (as expanded, of course, by the shell depending
	  on how the argument is quoted).</p>

	<p>Your output should look like the following (for a hypothetical pair of files):
	<pre>       $ ./gasp aardvark file1.txt file2.txt
       file1.txt:and the next day the aardvark ate a
       file1.txt:    The aardvark had a great day after that,
       file2.txt:not the most peaceful, but aardvarks</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are two available options, which may appear in any order if both
	  are present:
	  <ul>
	    <li><code>-i</code> Ignore case when searching for lines that
	      contain <code>STRING</code>.  If the <code>-i</code> option is
	      used, the strings &quot;<code>this</code>&quot;,
	      &quot;<code>This</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>THIS</code>&quot;, and
	      &quot;<code>thiS</code>&quot; all match; if <code>-i</code> is not
	      used, they are all considered different.</li>
	    <li><code>-n</code> Number lines in output. Each line copied
	      to <code>stdout</code> should include the line number in the file
	      where it was found in addition to the file name. The lines in each
	      file are numbered from 1.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>Your program does not need to be able to handle combinations of
	  option letters written as a single multi-character option like
	  <code>-in</code> or <code>-ni</code>. But it does need to be able to
	  handle any combination of either or both (or neither) option when they
	  appear separately on the command line preceding the <code>STRING</code>
	  argument.
	  You may assume that no option
	  occurs more than once (you do not need to check for this).</p>
	
	<p>(This is basically the same output produced by <code>fgrep</code>
	  or by <code>grep</code> if the <code>STRING</code> argument is
	  treated as literal data and not as a regular expression. You should
	  pretty much match the output format of <code>grep</code>
	  or <code>fgrep</code>, although your program's output does not need
	  to be byte-for-byte identical. One difference, though, is that a
	  file name should be printed on every output line, even if only one
	  file is specified on the <code>gasp</code> command line.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
	
	<p>Besides the general specification given above, your program should
	  meet the following requirements to receive full credit.
	  <ol>
	    <li>Be able to handle input lines containing up to 500 characters
	      (including the terminating <code>\0</code> byte). This number
	      should be specified with an appropriate <code>#define</code>
	      preprocessor command so it can be changed easily. Your program is
	      allowed to produce incorrect results or fail if presented with
	      input data files containing lines longer than this limit.</li>
	    
	    <li>You may assume that the string pattern on the command line is no
	      longer than 100 characters (including the
	      terminating <code>\0</code>). This length should also be specified
	      by an appropriate <code>#define</code>.</li>
	    
	    <li>Use standard C library functions where possible; do not
	      reimplement operations available in the basic libraries. For
	      instance, <code>strncpy</code> in <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>
	      can be used to copy <code>\0</code>-terminated strings; you should
	      not be writing loops to copy such strings one character at a
	      time.<br />
	      
	      Exception: there is a <code>getopt</code> function in the Linux
	      library that provides simplified handling of command line
	      options. For this assignment, only, you <em><b>may not
		  use</b></em> this function. You should implement the processing of
	      command line options yourself, of course using the string library
	      functions when these are helpful.</li>
	    
	    <li>You should use &quot;safe&quot; versions of file and string
	      handling routines such as <code>fgets</code>
	      and <code>strncpy</code> instead of routines
	      like <code>gets</code> and <code>strcpy</code>.  The safe
	      functions allow specification of maximum buffer or array lengths
	      and will not overrun adjacent memory if used properly.</li>
	    
	    <li>For the <code>-i</code> option, two characters are considered to
	      be equal ignoring case if they are the same when translated by
	      the <code>tolower(c)</code> function (or, alternatively,
	      <code>toupper(c)</code>) in <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code>.</li>
	    
	    <li>If an error occurs when opening or reading a file, the program
	      should write an appropriate error message to <code>stderr</code>
	      and continue processing any remaining files on the command
	      line.</li>
	    
	    <li>Your C code must be in a source file named <code>gasp.c</code>.
	      Since this program is relatively short, all of the functions should be
	      in this single file. You should arrange your code so that related
	      functions are grouped together in a logical order in the file.</li>
	    
	    <li>Your code must compile and run without errors or warnings when
	      compiled and executed on <code>klaatu</code> or the current CSE
	      Linux VM using <code>gcc</code> with the <code>-Wall</code>
	      and <code>-std=c11</code> options. Since this assignment should
	      not need to use any unusual or system-dependent code you can
	      probably develop and test your code on any recent Linux
	      system or other system that supports a standard C
	      compiler. However, we will test your submissions using the CSE
	      systems, so you should verify your program there before the
	      submission deadline.</li>
	    
	    <li>Your program must be robust.  It should not
	      crash (segfault or otherwise) or produce meaningless or incorrect
	      output regardless of the contents of command line parameters or input
	      files  (except, of course, you are not required to deal with files
	      or string parameters with lines longer than the limits given above).
	      If the program terminates prematurely because of some error,
	      it should print an appropriate error message to <code>stderr</code> and
	      exit with an exit code of <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> (defined in
	      <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> -- see the description of the
	      <code>exit()</code> function).</li>
	    
	    <li>If the program terminates normally after attempting to open and
	      process all of the files listed on the command line, it
	      should terminate with an exit
	      code of <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> (see <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>).
	      This is normally done by returning this value as the <code>int</code>
	      result of the <code>main</code> function.</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Code Quality Requirements</h2>
	<p>As with any program you write, your code should be readable and
	  understandable to anyone who knows C. In particular, for full credit
	  your code must observe the following requirements.
	  <ol>
	    <li>Divide your program into suitable functions, each of which does
	      a single well-defined task. For example, there should almost
	      certainly be a function that processes a single input file, which
	      is called as many times as needed to process each of the files
	      listed on the command line (and which, in turn, might call other
	      functions to perform identifiable subtasks). Your program most
	      definitely may not consist of one huge <code>main</code> function
	      that does everything. However it should not contain tiny functions
	      that only contain isolated statements or code fragments instead of
	      dividing the program into coherent pieces. If you wish, you may
	      include all of your functions in a single C source file, since the
	      total size of this program will be fairly small. Be sure to
	      include appropriate function prototype declarations near the
	      beginning of the file so the actual function definitions can
	      appear in whatever order is most appropriate for presenting the
	      code in the remainder of the file in a logical sequence and so that
	      related functions are grouped together.</li>
	    
	    <li>Comment sensibly, but not excessively. You should not use
	      comments to repeat the obvious or explain how the C language works
	      -- assume that the reader knows C at least as well as you. Your
	      code should, however, include the following minimum comments:
	      <ul>
		<li>Every function must include a heading comment that
		  explains what the function does (<em>not</em> how it does
		  it), including the significance of all parameters and any
		  effects on or use of global variables (to the extent that
		  there are any). It must <em>not</em> be necessary to read
		  the function code to determine how to call it or what
		  happens when it is called. (But these comments do not need
		  to be nearly as verbose as, for example Java's JavaDoc
		  comments.)</li>
		
		<li>Every significant variable must include a comment that is
		  sufficient to understand what information is stored in the
		  variable and how it is stored. It must <em>not</em> be
		  necessary to read code that initializes or uses a variable
		  to understand this. It may be helpful to describe several
		  related variables in a single comment that explains their
		  contents and relationship.</li>
		
		<li>In addition, there should be a comment at the top of the
		  file giving basic identifying information, including your
		  name, the date, and the name and purpose of the
		  file. </li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>Use appropriate names for variables and functions: nouns or noun
	      phrases suggesting the contents of variables or the results of
	      value-returning functions; verbs or verb phrases
	      for <code>void</code> functions that perform an action without
	      returning a value. Variables of local significance like loop
	      counters, indices, or pointers should be given simple names
	      like <code>i</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>n</code>,
	      or <code>p</code>, and often do not require further comments.</li>
	    
	    <li>No global variables. Use parameters (particularly pointers)
	      appropriately.  Exception: if you wish, you may have two global
	      variables that indicate whether the <code>-i</code>
	      or <code>-n</code> options are selected or not.</li>
	    
	    <li>No unnecessary computation. For example, if you need to
	      translate the <code>STRING</code> argument to lower- or
	      upper-case, translate it (or a copy of it) once; don't do this
	      repeatedly every time you read a new line from an input file.
	      Don't make unnecessary copies of
	      large data structures; use pointers. (Copies of <code>int</code>s,
	      pointers, and similar things are cheap; copies of arrays and large
	      structs are expensive.) Don't read the input by calling a library
	      function to read each individual character. Read the input a line
	      at a time (it costs just about the same to call an I/O function to
	      read an entire line into a char array as it does to read a single
	      character). But don't overdo it. Your code should be simple and
	      clear, not complex containing lots of micro-optimizations that
	      don't matter.</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  You should use the <a href="clint.py">clint.py</a> style checker
	  (right-click to download, and <code>chmod +x</code> to make it
	  executable if needed) to review your code.  While this checker may
	  flag a few things that you wish to leave as-is, most of the things it
	  catches, including whitespace errors in the code, should be fixed.  We
	  will run this style checker on your code to check for any issues that
	  should have been fixed.  Use the discussion board or office hours if
	  you have questions about particular clint warnings.
	</p>
	
	<p>Hint: All reasonable programming text editors have commands or
	  settings to use spaces instead of tabs at the beginning of lines,
	  which is required by the style checker and is much more robust than
	  having tabs in the code.  For example, if you are a emacs user, you
	  can add the following line to the <code>.emacs</code> file in your
	  home directory to ensure that emacs translates leading tabs to
	  spaces:<br><code>(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)</code>.
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Implementation Hints</h2>

	<p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>There are a lot of things to get right here; the job may seem
	      overwhelming if you try to do all of it at once. But if you break
	      it into small tasks, each one of which can be done individually by
	      itself, it should be quite manageable.  For instance, figure out
	      how to process a single file before you implement the logic to
	      process all of the files on the command line. Figure out how to
	      open, read, and copy all of a file to <code>stdout</code> before
	      you add the code to search for the <code>STRING</code> argument
	      and selectively print lines containing it. Be able to search for
	      exact matches before adding the <code>-i</code> option. Add
	      the <code>-n</code> option separately when you're not trying to do
	      something else.</li>
	    
	    <li>Think before you code.  You will ultimately get the job done
	      faster, better, and with less pain if you spend some time to sketch
	      your design (which functions are needed? what exactly do they do? what
	      are the main data structures?) before you write detailed code.  Start
	      coding by writing function headings and heading comments and creating
	      significant variables -- and commenting those too.  Then as you write
	      detailed code and test it you will have your written design
	      information in the comments to compare and check as you work on the
	      code.  That should greatly reduce the number of bugs that wind up in
	      the code and ultimately help you get correct, working code faster and
	      with less effort.</li>
	    
	    <li>Every time you add something new to your code (see hint #1),
	      test it. Right Now! <em>Immediately!!</em> <em>BEFORE YOU
		DO <strong>ANYTHING</strong> ELSE!!!</em> (Did we mention that you
	      should test new changes right away?) It is much easier to find and
	      fix problems if you can isolate the potential bug to a small
	      section of code you just added or changed. The debugger is your
	      friend here-- learn how to use it (and you are required to do
	      this). <code>printf</code> can also be your friend to print values
	      while executing and testing the code. </li>
	    
	    <li>The standard C library contains many functions that you will
	      find useful.  In particular, look at the <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, 
	      <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code>
	      and <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> libraries.  Use the reference
	      link on the course home page to look up details about functions
	      and their parameters; use a good book like <i>The C Programming
		Language</i> for background and perspective about how they are
	      intended to be used.
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>Use the compiler <code>-Wall</code> option and (if you can) the
	      runtime <code>assert</code> function (in <code>assert.h</code>) to
	      catch coding bugs and to check for things that "must happen" or
	      "can't happen" during execution.  Don't waste time manually
	      searching for errors that the compiler or run-time tests could have
	      caught for you.</li>
	    
	    <li>An easy way to implement the <code>-i</code> option is to
	      translate both the <code>STRING</code> argument and each input
	      line to lowercase, then search for the
	      translated <code>STRING</code> in the translated input
	      line. (Translating a string to lower-case sure sounds like a
	      well-defined operation that should be in a separate function!)
	      However, if the string is found, the original line from the input
	      file should be printed, not the translated one.</li>
	    
	    <li>Be sure to test for errors like trying to open or read a
	      nonexistent file to see if your error handling is working
	      properly.</li>
	    
	    <li>Once you're done, read the instructions again to see if you
	      overlooked anything.</li>
	    
	    <li>See #8.</li>
	  </ol>

      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Debugging</h2>

	<p>Learning how to use a debugger effectively can be a big help in
	  getting your programs to work (although it is no substitute for
	  thinking and careful programming). To encourage you to gain a basic
	  familiarity with <code>gdb</code>, you are required to do the
	  following:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Be sure your program is compiled with the <code>-g</code>
	      option, to include debugging information in the executable
	      file.</li>
	    
	    <li>Run the <code>script</code> program to capture the following
	      console session in a text file named <code>debug.script</code>.</li>
	    
	    <li>Start <code>gdb</code> with your executable program as an
	      argument.</li>
	    
	    <li>Set two breakpoints: one at the beginning of <code>main</code>,
	      and the other at the point in your program right after
	      the <code>fopen</code> function call that opens the input
	      files.</li>
	    
	    <li>Start your program with the <code>gdb</code> <code>run</code>
	      command, providing a search string and at least one file name as
	      arguments.</li>
	    
	    <li>When the program hits the breakpoint at the beginning
	      of <code>main</code>, use the appropriate <code>gdb</code> command
	      to display the contents of the variable containing the search
	      string (the first argument to the program following any options
	      that are present). When you've done that, continue execution of
	      the program.</li>
	    
	    <li>When the program hits the second breakpoint immediately after
	      opening an input file, use the appropriate <code>gdb</code>
	      commands to display (i) a backtrace showing the functions active
	      at the time the breakpoint was reached, (ii) source code showing
	      the line containing the breakpoint and a couple of surrounding
	      lines, (iii) the name of the file that was supplied to
	      the <code>fopen</code> function (this string should be in a
	      variable somewhere), and (iv) the pointer value returned
	      by <code>fopen</code> (presumably just a hex address, although it
	      might be <code>NULL</code> if the file can't be opened).</li>
	    
	    <li>Continue execution of the program until it stops, then
	      quit <code>gdb</code> and exit from the <code>script</code>
	      program's shell. Save the <code>debug.script</code> output file
	      from <code>script</code> to turn in later.</li>
	  </ol>
	  
	<p>You should use <code>gdb</code>'s basic command-line interface for
	  this part of the assignment, even if you use the <code>-tui</code>
	  option for your routine debugging. The full-screen <code>-tui</code>
	  interface generates a great deal of extra output in the script file,
	  which makes it almost impossible to read.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
	
	<p>A small amount of extra credit will be awarded for adding the
	  following extensions to an already complete, working assignment. No
	  extra credit will be awarded if the basic program is not fully
	  implemented and substantially bug-free.</p>
	
	<p>If you do any extra credit parts, you should turn in both your
	  original program without the extra credit and your extended program. The
	  extra credit version should be in a separate file named
	  <code>gasp-extra.c</code>.  Your <code>README</code> file (see turn-in
	  instructions below) should contain a brief description of your extensions.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Allow input file names to be omitted from the command line. In
	      this case, when no filenames are given the program should read
	      data from <code>stdin</code>.  This should be fairly easy to add
	      if your code is organized as a well-designed collection of
	      functions.</li>
	    
	    <li>Add an option <code>-w</code> to search for words separated by
	      whitespace.  If <code>-w</code> is specified,
	      the <code>STRING</code> on the <code>gasp</code> command line
	      should only be found if it is surrounded by whitespace (blanks,
	      tabs, newlines, etc.) in the input file(s) and not as part of some
	      other string. For example, the <code>STRING foo</code> would
	      match <code>foo</code> but not <code>food</code>. A
	      character <code>c</code> in the input should be treated as
	      whitespace if the library function call <code>isspace(c)</code>
	      returns true. If you implement this option, the program should
	      find the word if it appears at the beginning or end of a line, as
	      well as in the middle. You may also use an additional global
	      variable to record the state of this option if you wish.</li>
	    
	    <li>Enhance your program so it can deal safely with input files
	      containing lines of an arbitrary length. Lines longer than the
	      program is prepared to handle may be truncated by discarding
	      excess input characters, but doing so should not cause
	      the <code>-n</code> option to count line numbers incorrectly.
	      However you decide to implement this, long input lines should not
	      cause your program to fail or crash.</li>
	    
	    <li>A bit harder than above: Enhance your program so it correctly
	      deals with input lines of any length, copying them to the output if
	      they contain the <code>STRING</code> parameter anywhere in the line.
	      If you read arbitrarily long input lines in chunks that contain only
	      parts of an input line, be sure you can correctly handle situations
	      where the <code>STRING</code> value appears in a line but spans two
	      parts of the line instead of falling entirely inside of one chunk. For
	      efficiency reasons you should continue to read the input in large
	      chunks, not a character at a time.</li>
	  </ul>
