	<h2>Assignment goals</h2>
	<p>In this assignment, you will develop a more complex program using dynamic
	  data structures. In doing so you will:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Gain  experience developing a larger system one part at a
	    time, testing as you go.</li>
	  <li>Learn about  the trie  data structure, a version of
	    a search tree.</li>
	  <li>Gain experience working with trees, structs, and dynamically allocated data.</li>
	  <li>Gain more experience reading and processing text files in C.</li>
	  
          <li>Practice writing simple Makefiles.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>This is a significantly larger task than the previous programming assignment!</b> Start early.</p>
	<h2>Synopsis</h2>
	<p>In this assignment, you will build programs to implement T9 predictive text,
	  a text input mode developed originally for cell phones and
	  still used for numeric keypads. Each number
	  from 2-9 on the keypad represents three or four letters, the number 0 represents
	  a space, and 1 represents a set of symbols such as { , . ! ? } etc. The numbers
	  from 2-9 represent letters as follows:<br />
	  <br>
	  2 => ABC <br>
	  3 => DEF <br>
	  4 => GHI <br>
	  5 => JKL <br>
	  6 => MNO<br>
	  7 => PQRS <br>
	  8 => TUV <br>
	  9 => WXYZ
	<p>Since multiple letters map to a single number, many key sequences represent
	  multiple words. For example, the input 2665 represents "book&quot; and &quot;cool",
  among other possibilities.</p>
	<pre>
          2       6       6       5              2       6       6       5
        a B c   m n O   m n O   j K l    OR    a b C   m n O   m n O   j k L
	  |         |       |     |                |       |       |       |
	   -----------------------                  -----------------------
	             |                                         |
	            book                                      cool</pre>
	<p>To translate from number sequences to words, we will use a data structure
	  known as a trie. A trie is a multiway branching structure (tree) that stores
	  the prefixes of sequences. As we travel down a path in the trie, we reach word
	  sequences spelled
	  out by the numbers along that path. Classic trie data structures have edges
	  labeled with letters to store  prefixes of strings. But for this application,
	  we use a compressed trie that has only 10 possible branches at each node
	  instead of 26, since the digits 0-9 represent
	  the 26 letters, space and symbols. Because of this, 
	  an extra layer of complexity is needed to figure out the string represented
	  by a path.</p>
	
	<p>(Actually, for our application, each node only needs 8 possible
	  children numbered 2-9, since digits 0 and 1 don't encode letters.  But
	  writing the code might be easier if nodes have 10 children numbered 0-9,
	  since then subtree number <i>n</i> corresponds to digit <i>n</i>. Feel
	  free to use either representation for the trie depending on which seems
	  simpler to implement.)</p>
	
	<p>For more information on the trie data structure, <a
							       href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">here</a> is a link to the
	  Wikipedia article.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Technical Requirements </h2>
	
	<p>Implement in C a program <code>t9</code>. The command</p>
	<pre>     $ ./t9 FILE</pre>
	<p>should read in a dictionary file (<code>FILE</code>) that contains a list
	  of words. Translate each word in the dictionary  into its numeric key sequence,
	  then add the
	  key sequence to your trie, with the word at the end of the path corresponding
	  to the digits. If a word with the same numeric  sequence already exists in
	  the trie, add the new word to the trie as a link to a new node with an edge
	  labeled '#' instead of one of the digits 2-9. (The words linked from a 
	  node by the '#' edges essentially form a "linked list" of words that have the
	  same numeric code, but we use additional tree nodes to link the words together
	  instead of defining a separate kind of linked-list node just for this situation.)
	<p>For example, if the program reads the set of words "jello","rocks",
	  and "socks" from
	  the dictionary and adds it to an empty trie, the resulting trie should look
	  like this:<br />
	  <br>
	  <img src="hw5/exampleTrie.jpg" width="800" height="630" />
	  
	<p> Once your program has read the dictionary and built the trie
	  containing the words in it, it should start an interactive session. The
	  user should be able to type numbers and the program should print out the
	  word corresponding to the sequence of numbers entered. Your program
	  should use the numbers typed by the user to traverse the trie that has
	  already been created,  retrieve the word, and print it to the screen.
	  If the user then enters '#', the program should print the next word in
	  the trie that has the same numeric value, and so forth. The user can
	  also type a number followed by one or more '#' characters - this should
	  print the same word that would be found by typing the number and
	  individual '#' characters on separate input lines.</p>
	
	<p>As an example, if we run the program using the above trie,
	  an interactive session might look like this:</br>
	  <pre>
	    Enter "exit" to quit.
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > 76257
	    'rocks'
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > #
	    'socks'
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > 53556
	    'jello'
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > #
	    There are no more T9onyms
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > 76257#
	    'socks'
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > 76257##
	    There are no more T9onyms
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > 4423
	    Not found in current dictionary.
	    Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
	    > exit
	</pre></p>
	
	<p>The interactive session should terminate either when the user enters the
	  word "exit" or when the end-of-file is reached on the interactive input (indicated by 
	  typing control-D on the keyboard on a separate line by itself).</p>
	
	<p> Note: Make sure your program properly handles the case if the user
	  types more "#"s than there are T9onyms for a particular number.</p>
	
	<p>We provide you with two text files, <code><a
							href="hw5/smallDictionary.txt">smallDictionary.txt</a></code> and
	  <code><a href="hw5/dictionary.txt">dictionary.txt</a></code>
	  (right-click on the links to download the files). Each  of these text
	  files contains a list of words to be used in constructing a trie - the
	  small one primarily for testing, and the large one for the final
	  program. Translate each word in the file into its associated T9 key
	  sequence, and add the word to the trie. In the case of multiple words
	  having the same key sequence <em>k</em>, let the first word encountered
	  in the text file be represented by the key sequence <em>k</em>, the next
	  encountered represented by <em>k</em>#, the next <em>k</em>##, etc. For
	  example, 2273 can represent acre, bard, bare, base, cape, card, care, or
	  case. To disambiguate,  acre would be represented by 2273, bard by
	  2273#, bare by 2273##,  and so forth. When a user inputs a key sequence,
	  print the appropriate word.</p>
	
	<p>Your trie data structure should contain nodes to represent the
	  tree, and strings (char arrays) containing copies of the words read
	  from the dictionary file, linked to appropriate nodes in the trie.</p>
	
	<p>Besides the general specification given above, your program should
	  meet the following requirements to receive full credit.</p>
	<p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>You should create a <code>Makefile</code> and use <code>make</code>
	      to compile your program. Your <code>Makefile</code>  should only
	      recompile the necessary part(s) of the program after changes are
	      made.</li>
	    
	    <li>Use <code>malloc</code> to dynamically allocate the nodes, strings, and
	      any other data that make up your trie.</li>
	    
	    <li>If you need to create a copy of a string or other variable-size
	      data, you should dynamically allocate an appropriate amount of storage
	      using <code>malloc</code> and release the storage with <code>free</code>
	      when you are done with it. The amount allocated should be based on the
	      actual size needed, not some arbitrary size that is assumed to be "large
	      enough".</li>
	    
	    <li>Use standard C library functions where possible; do not reimplement
	      operations   available in the standard libraries.</li>
	    
	    <li>You must check the return status (result code) of every library
	      function you call to be sure that no errors occurred.  In particular,
	      <code>malloc</code> will return <code>NULL</code> if it is unable to
	      allocate storage. Although this is extremely unlikely to happen, a
	      robust program must check for the possibility and react appropriately if
	      it does.</li>
	    
	    <li>If an error occurs when opening or reading a file, the program should write
	      an appropriate error message to <code>stderr</code> and terminate if there
	      is no further work to be done.</li>

	    <li>Before the program terminates, all dynamically allocated data must
	      be properly freed (i.e., <code>free</code> everything acquired with
	      <code>malloc</code>). This should be done explicitly without relying on
	      the operating system to clean up after the program finishes.</li>

	    <li>Your code must compile and run without errors or warnings when
	      compiled with <code>gcc -Wall</code> on klaatu or the CSE Linux
	      VM<code></code>. Your program should build without errors when
	      <code>make</code> is used  to run your <code>Makefile</code>. You are,
	      of course, free to use other systems for development, and you should be
	      fine as long as you have a relatively recent version of gcc. But we will
	      test the code on the CSE Linux machines.</li>

	    <li>Your program should terminate cleanly with no memory leaks or other
	      memory errors reported when it is run using <code>valgrind</code>.
	      (Warning: <code>valgrind</code> slows down execution considerably. It
	      will take several minutes to load the full dictionary.txt file and then
	      free the resulting tree under <code>valgrind</code>. We suggest you use
	      smaller input files during development to test for memory problems with
	      <code>valgrind</code>.) If memory leaks are detected,
	      <code>valgrind</code>'s <code>--leak-check=full</code> option will be
	      useful to generate more extensive messages with information about the
	      memory leaks. </li>
	</ol></p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Code Quality Requirements</h2>

	<p>As with any program you write, your code should be readable and understandable to anyone who knows
	  C. In particular, for full credit your code must observe the following requirements.</p>
	
	<p><ol>
	    <li>Divide your program into suitable source files (at least three) and
	      functions, each of which does a single well-defined aspect of the
	      assignment. For example, there should almost certainly be a header and
	      source file for the trie data structure and the operations needed on it
	      (create a new empty trie, insert a word, search, delete the trie, etc.),
	      and an additional file that contains the the main part of the program
	      that uses the trie data structure. Your program most definitely may not
	      consist of one huge main function that does everything. </li>
	    
	    <li>The header (<code>.h</code>) file for the trie (and any other header
	      files) should only declare items that are shared between client programs
	      that use the header and the file(s) that implement it. Don't include in
	      the header file implementation details that should be hidden. Be sure to
	      use the standard <code>#ifndef</code> preprocessor trick so your header
	      files work properly if included more than once in a source file, either
	      directly or indirectly.</li>
	    
	    <li>Be sure to include appropriate function prototypes near the beginning of each
	      source file for functions defined in that file whose declarations are not included in a header file.</li>
	    
	    <li> Comment sensibly, but not excessively. You should not use comments
	      to repeat the obvious or explain how the C language works - assume that
	      the reader knows C at least as well as you do. Your code should,
	      however, include the following minimum comments:
	      
	      <ul><li>Every function must include a heading comment that explains what
		  the function does (not how it does it), including the significance of
		  all parameters. It must not be necessary to read the function code to
		  determine how to call it or what happens when it is called. (But these
		  comments do not need to be nearly as verbose as, for example JavaDoc
		  comments.)</li>
		
		<li>Every significant variable must include a comment
		  that is sufficient to understand the information  in the variable and
		  how it is stored. It must not be necessary to read code that initializes
		  or uses a variable to understand this.</li>
		
		<li>Every source file should begin with a comment identifying the file,
		  author, and purpose (i.e., the assignment or project).</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    
	    <li> Use appropriate names for variables and functions: nouns or noun
	      phrases suggesting the contents of variables and the results of
	      value-returning functions; verbs or verb phrases for <code>void</code>
	      functions that perform an action without returning a value. Variables
	      of local significance like loop counters or indices should be given
	      simple names like <code>i,</code> <code>n</code>, or <code>p</code> and
	      do not require further comments. Avoid names like <code>count</code> or
	      <code>flag</code> that provide no useful information - use names that
	      suggests the values being counted or the condition that is
	      represented.</li>
	    
	    <li>No global variables. Use parameters (particularly pointers) appropriately.
	      Exceptions: if you wish, you may have global variables that record the settings
	      of any command-line options added for the extra credit part (if you create
	      any of these). It also may be appropriate to use global variables for constant
	      data like translation tables if the program is better structured this way.</li>
	    
	    <li>No unnecessary computation or excessive use of <code>malloc</code>
	      or <code>free</code>  - these are expensive. Don't make unnecessary
	      copies of large data structures; use pointers. (Copies of ints,
	      pointers, and similar things are cheap; copies of large arrays and
	      structs are expensive.)</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>As with the previous assignment, we strongly suggest that you use the
	  <a href="clint.py">clint.py</a> style checker (right-click to download,
	  and <code>chmod +x</code> to make it executable) to review your code.
	  While this checker may flag a few things that you wish to leave as-is,
	  most of the things it catches, including whitespace errors in the code,
	  should be fixed.  We will run this style checker on your code to check
	  for any issues that should have been fixed.  Please use the class
	  discussion board if you have questions about any of clint's warnings and
	  whether they can be ignored. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Implementation Hints</h2>
	
	<ol>
	  <li>There are a lot of things to get right here; the job may seem
	    overwhelming if you try to do it all at once. But if you break it into
	    small tasks, each one of which can be done individually by itself, it
	    should be quite manageable. For instance, design the structure of the
	    trie and the structs (and struct fields) you need. Figure out how to add a single
	    word to the trie  before you implement the logic to process all of the
	    words in the dictionary. Figure out how to add a few words that have
	    different numeric codes before you  handle words that have the same
	    codes. Implement the code to traverse the trie to translate an input key
	    sequence into the corresponding word once you've built the trie, not
	    before.</li>
	  
	  <li>Before you start typing code into the computer, spend some time
	    sketching out data structures and code (particularly trie node
	    <code>struct</code>s) on paper or on a whiteboard. Be sure you
	    understand what you are trying to do before you start typing.</li>
	  
	  <li>Every time you add something new to your code (see hint #1), test
	    it. <strong>Right Now!</strong> It is much easier to find and fix
	    problems if you can isolate the potential bug to a small section of code
	    you just added or changed. <code>gdb</code> and <code>printf</code> are
	    your friends here to examine values while debugging.</li>
	  
	  <li>You will probably find it very useful to include code that can print
	    the contents of the trie in some understandable format. This is not
	    required, but how can you be sure your code is correct if you can't look
	    at the trie that is built for a small set of input data?</li>
	  
	  <li>Start with a small data file and figure out in advance what the
	    resulting trie should look like. Then verify that the program does, in
	    fact, create that trie.</li>
	  
	  <li><code>gdb</code> is your friend.</li>
	  
	  <li>To build the trie, you need some way to translate characters
	    (primarily letters) from words in the dictionary file to the
	    corresponding keypad digits. It is probably a great idea to include in
	    your code a function that takes a character as an argument and returns
	    the corresponding digit. This can be implemented with a series of
	    <code>if-elseif-else</code> statements, but another way to do it is to
	    have an array with one entry for each possible character. In the entry
	    for each character, store the corresponding digit code. Then you can
	    look up the code for a character without a complicated nest of
	    <code>if</code> statements. (Recall that in C, as in Java and other
	    languages, a character can be used as a small integer. That is
	    particularly helpful for exactly this kind of application, where we
	    might want to use a character value as an index into a table of
	    data.)</li>
	  
	  <li>Be sure to check for errors like trying to open a nonexistent file
	    to see if your error handling is working properly.</li>
	  
	  <li>Once you're done, read the instructions again to see if you overlooked anything.</li>
	  
	  <li>Reread the previous hint and obey.</li>
	</ol>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
	
	<p>A small amount of extra credit will be awarded for adding the
	  following extensions to an already complete, working assignment. No
	  extra credit will be awarded if the basic program is not fully
	  implemented and substantially bug-free. You should also turn in your
	  working assignment before attempting any extra credit, and turn in a
	  second archive containing the enhanced program later (see instructions
	  below).
	  <ul>
	    <li>Add  functionality to allow users to give a prefix of a word as
	      input instead of requiring entry of complete words. When a '#' is
	      entered, if the numbers entered so far are only the prefix of a
	      word, the program should print a word that begins with this prefix.
	      (i,e, if '22' is the input and the user enters '#', the output might
	      be cab; if the user types "#" again, the output might be cap;"##" :
	      car ,...etc., depending on how the words are stored in the
	      dictionary)</li>
	    
	    <li>    Store the words in the trie so that if a numeric sequence
	      matches several possible words, the most likely word is presented
	      first, based on how frequently different words with the same numeric
	      sequence actually appear in English text. The data file
	      <a href="hw5/freq_Dictionary.txt"><code>freq_Dictionary.txt</code></a>
	      (right-click to download) contains a list of words with, in
	      addition, the frequency of each word in ordinary text. Use the
	      information in this file to construct your trie so the most likely
	      words are reached first.  Warning: the data in this file has some
	      problems, like duplicate entries for some words.  You will need to
	      figure out how best to use this data, or find different data that is
	      more helpful.</li>
	    <li>Dynamically update the frequencies of words in the trie. The idea here
	      is that if someone uses a particular word often, it should be presented
	      first before other words that have the same numeric code. To do this,
	      you need to rearrange the trie as the program runs so that frequently
	      used words move to locations higher up in the trie. Or you might want to
	      change the trie so that words with the same numeric spelling are stored
	      as a linked list anchored at a single trie node that represents that sequence
	      of numbers, and move words to the front of their linked list when they are used.</li>
	    <li>Feel free to experiment with additional extensions.</li>
	</ul></p>
	
	<p>If you include extensions in your program, you should also include a <code>README</code>  file
	  that describes what you added and how to demonstrate your addition(s) when
	  your program is executed.</p>

	<h2>What to turn in</h2>

	<p>Create an uncompressed tar file named <code>hw5.tar</code> containing
	  your source code and <code>Makefile</code>, and submit that using the
	  normal class dropbox. You can do this with the command
<pre>        $ tar cvf hw5.tar Makefile ...</pre> where <code>...</code> is replaced by the
	  list of additional files you want to include in your submission.</p>
	
	<p>If you do any extra credit extensions later, create a second tar file
	  named <code>hw5-extra.tar</code> containing the extra-credit version of
	  your source code, <code>Makefile</code>, and the <code>README</code>
	  file describing your extensions. Turn in that second archive in addition
	  to the first archive containing containing the solution to the required
	  part of the assignment.</p>
