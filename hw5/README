Feedback:
(-0) A function other than main should not prematurely exit out of a running program. 
Eg: malloc fails. Instead, it should return a NULL or some status back and let the 
calling function handle appropriately.
(-1) check_malloc is an unnecessary function. Factor out meaningful blocks of code in 
to helper functions. In this case, making a function call, just for one if statement 
is a lot of overhead for too little work.
(-1) Program doesn't exit gracefully on Ctrl+D or EOF.
