	<h1>Homework 0 (CSE 374 Spring 2018)</h1>
	<p><b>Due: Wednesday, March 28, 2018, at 11 pm
	    (you <em>really <u>really</u> </em>don't want to burn up late days on this one!).</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	The purpose of this assignment is to be sure that you have your
	Linux environment set up for the quarter and that you can log in and
	execute shell commands. For this assignment you <i>must</i> use
	either your
	account on the <code>klaatu.cs.washington.edu</code> machine or your
	own copy of the CSE Linux Virtual Machine.  It is possible to use
	another reasonably recent Linux system for many things, but we will
	use the CSE systems to evaluate submitted work, and you need to
	verify that everything you submit works correctly there.  See
	the <em><a href="../linux.html">Linux Resources</a></em> page on the
	course web site for more information about how to get started.
	
	  <ol start="0">
	    <li>(Shell) You <em><strong>must</strong></em> be sure that your
	      default shell is <code>bash</code>.  Otherwise you will run into
	      strange, baffling problems with shell scripts.  Enter the
	      command <code>echo $SHELL</code>. The response should
	      be <code>/bin/bash</code>.  If the shell name is different
	      (<code>csh</code>, <code>tcsh</code>, or something else), use the
	      appropriate commands on your system to change your login shell
	      to <code>bash</code>. On many Linux and Unix systems this can be
	      done with the command <code>chsh</code>
	      or <code>ypchsh</code>.<br>
	      <br>
	    </li>
	    <li>(Commands) Open a shell window and enter the following
	      commands. They should work without errors if typed exactly as shown.
	      (Exception: if you are using <code>klaatu</code>, omit the <code>cd
		Desktop</code> command.  There is no <code>Desktop</code> directory
	      on <code>klaatu</code> accounts.)  The <code>script</code> command
	      will capture the terminal session and save it in a file
	      named <code>hw0.script</code> in the current directory.<br>
	      <pre>
    cd 
    cd Desktop  # omit if using klaatu
    script hw0.script
    whoami
    echo $SHELL
    pwd
    uname -a
    cat /etc/redhat-release
    gcc --version -std=c11
    exit</pre>
	      Notes: if the <code>gcc</code> command
	      generates a warning that -std=c11 is not a recognized option, your
	      C compiler and, probably, your Linux version are too old, and you
	      should use the current UW CSE Linux system for this class.<br><br>
	      The <code>cat /etc/redhat-release</code> command should print a message that begins with <code>CentOS Linux release 7.4</code>... .
	      If it does not, or if you get a message that the file is not found, you are not
	      using a properly configured UW CSE Linux machine, and you should repeat
	      the assignment once you fix that.
	      <br><br>
	    </li>	
	    <li>(Chatting) Go the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1199331/discussion_topics">course discussion board</a> and post a followup to the Welcome message to introduce yourself.</li>
	  </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<b>Assessment:</b> Your solution will be evaluated on how well it
	follows the instructions and produces the desired results.  Note:
	the <code>script</code> command captures <i>everything</i>,
	including backspaces and other corrections as you are typing input.
	It's fine if there is some of this in the submitted file, but if
	there is too much clutter or too many mistakes, it would be best to
	start over and get a reasonably clean <code>hw0.script</code> file
	to turn in.
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<p><b>Turn-in Instructions:</b> Use the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1199331/assignments/4169307">turn-in drop box link</a> on the main
	  course web page to turn in the <code>hw0.script</code> file created in
	  problem 1.  The drop box will allow you to turn in your homework up to
	  two days late, if you choose to use one or two of your late days, but
	  you are <em><b><u>strongly</u></b></em> advised to save your late days
	  for much later in the quarter when you may really want them.</p>
	
	<p>If you are still trying to register for the course, email the
	  course staff (use the correct <code>cse374-staff</code> email address)
	  to get a <code>klaatu</code> account, and you will be able to run the
	  assignment there and submit using the dropbox.</p>
	
	<p>If you create the <code>hw0.script</code> file on <code>klaatu</code>,
	  you can use <code>scp</code> (<code>winscp</code> on windows)
	  to transfer the file to your local
	  machine so it can be submitted using your local web browser.
	  If you are using the UW CSE Linux virtual machine, you can run a web
	  browser on the VM to submit the files from there.</p>
