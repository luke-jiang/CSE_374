	<h1>Homework 7 (CSE 374 Spring 2018)</h1>

	<h2>Synopsis</h2>

	<p>In this assignment you will supply the implementation of a C++ type
	  for Rational numbers. You should do this assignment alone. We will
	  supply you with  a small calculator program that evaluates  arithmetic
	  expressions using your code. You can use this to experiment with and
	  test your implementation. But your only job is to provide an
	  implementation of type <code>Rational</code>. As a reminder, in mathematics,
	  a rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or
	  fraction <code>p / q</code> of two integers, a numerator <code>p</code> and
	  a non-zero denominator <code>q</code>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>Type Rational</h2>

	<p><code>Rational</code> is specified in  file <code>Rational.h</code>;
	  there is a corresponding implementation file <code>Rational.cpp</code> in the
	  starter code that is empty. Your job is to supply an implementation of
	  <code>Rational</code> in  file <code>Rational.cpp</code>.</p>
	
	<p>You should download  the archive <a href="rational.tar"><code>rational.tar</code></a>
	  (right-click the link), which contains the starter code. File
	  <code>Rational.h</code> in the starter code contains descriptions of the
	  operations of the type; to save space these are not repeated here. The
	  archive also contains the source code for a small calculator program
	  that uses <code>Rational</code>s and a simple <code>Makefile</code> to
	  build it.</p>
	
	<p>Your implementation of <code>Rationals</code> should return values in
	  lowest (i.e., factored) terms. In other words, the greatest common
	  divisor of the numerator and denominator of a <code>Rational</code>
	  should be 1, as far as can be detected by a program using type
	  <code>Rational</code>. Furthermore, as far as an observer can tell, the
	  denominator of a <code>Rational</code> should always be non-negative;
	  the numerator may be positive or negative as appropriate. This does not
	  constrain how <code>Rationals</code> are actually represented, just how
	  they can be observed to behave.</p>
	
	<p>You should implement type <code>Rational</code> as defined in
	  <code>Rational.h</code>. You may not modify the contents of this header
	  file or add or delete anything from it. You are free, of course, to
	  include additional helper functions and data in your
	  <code>Rational.cpp</code> implementation file if these are useful.</p>
	
	<p>You do not need to check for or deal with rationals that have a denominator
	  of 0 or similar issues. If a client of type <code>Rational</code> creates a
	  <code>Rational</code> with a denominator of 0, or if a calculation produces
	  such a result, simply create that result and return it.</p>

	<p>You should use good style in your code, just like in our C programs,
	  including using clint.py to check for issues.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>The Calculator</h2>

	<p>The calculator program (supplied) is a simple line-oriented
	  calculator for expressions involving rational numbers. Rationals can be
	  entered as either a positive integer <em>n</em>, meaning <em>n</em>/1,
	  or as a pair of positive integers separated by a slash:
	  <em>n</em>/<em>d</em>. Numbers can be combined in expressions in the
	  usual way with the operators +, -, *, and % (for divide - the / isn't used
	  to indicate division of two rationals since it is used to enter
	  a single rational value). Spaces may separate parts of expressions, and
	  subexpressions can be surrounded by parentheses. One limitation is that
	  the calculator only implements binary operators; in particular it
	  doesn't support unary minus. To compute -<em>r</em>, you can evaluate
	  0-<em>r</em>. All expressions must be entered on a single line, and the
	  calculator evaluates the expression on each input line and prints the
	  result. The end of input is indicated by typing the usual end-of-file
	  character (ctrl-D in Linux shell windows). The calculator makes no
	  effort to detect or report errors such as illegal input, additional
	  characters on the input line following a complete expression, or
	  rationals with a denominator of 0. If it is unable to make sense out of
	  something, it usually generates the result 0/0 and goes on to process
	  the  next input line.</p>

	<p>Remember  that your job in this assignment is only to implement type
	  <code>Rational</code>. The calculator program is intended as a way of
	  testing and demonstrating that your <code>Rational</code> type works
	  properly, but you are not responsible for any of its quirks or for
	  fixing any odd behavior that you may discover.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
	<h2>What to Turn In</h2>

	<p>You should  turn in only the file <code>Rational.cpp</code> containing your
	  implementation of type <code>Rational</code>. Be sure to include your name
	  at the top of the file. Use the regular Canvas dropbox.</p>
